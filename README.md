# AIA Chain

## Introduction to AIA Chain
AIA Chain is a distributed public blockchain designed to become an efficient, secure, and decentralized infrastructure that supports asset issuance and exchange. The AIA chain is compatible with EVM and supports smart contracts. Anyone can join and build dApps and applications on it. The original digital asset of the AIA chain is AIA, which uses a consensus-based Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus algorithm.

## Declaration
We believe in the power of blockchain technology, which will make society more just, transparent and open. We are committed to promoting the development and application of this technology, abide by the principles of honesty, fairness, transparency, openness and trust, and let the blockchain create greater value for the entire human society. We look forward to a more open, transparent, free and equal future , thriving world!

## AIA’s Performance
- TPS: 2000+
- Average block interval: 3s

## Consensus Mechanism
Adopt the consensus-based Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus algorithm APoS consensus mechanism, which has the characteristics of low transaction cost, low transaction delay, and high transaction concurrency.

The maximum number of validators supported is 21.

## Economic Model
The endogenous token on the chain is AIA; the transactions consume AIA as gas fee.

Miners pledge AIA to become validator nodes. The reward of nodes is gas fee, which is distributed according to the mortgage proportion.

## AIA Technical Characteristics
- Decentralization: The AIA chain adopts a decentralized method for transaction processing and smart contract execution. There is no central organization to control and manage transactions, which makes the AIA chain more open and transparent.
- Smart contracts: AIA chain supports smart contracts, which can automatically execute and manage incentives.
- EVM: AIA chain uses EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) to make smart contract execution easy, flexible and secure, while reducing the cost of developing or migrating DAPP;
- Low transaction fees: AIA chain uses a unique Gas fee system to calculate the cost of transactions and smart contract operations. Adopting this system can enable users to control the cost of transactions and smart contracts more flexibly, and consume less handling fees when executing contract operations, reducing development or migration costs.
